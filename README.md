Code Challenge Instructions
In the programming language of your choice, write a program that parses a sentence and
replaces each word with the following: first letter, number of distinct characters between first and
last character, and last letter. Words are separated by spaces or non-alphabetic characters and
these separators should be maintained in their original form and location in the answer. 

Examples: 
1. “Smooth” becomes “S3h” 
2. “Space separated” becomes “S3e s5d” 
3. “Dash-separated” becomes “D2h-s5d” 
4. “Number2separated” becomes “N4r2s5d”
